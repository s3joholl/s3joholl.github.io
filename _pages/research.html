        Gene-Environment Interactions with Essential Heterogeneity

    <div class="abstract">
      We study how gene-environment interactions between education and genetic endowments affect cognition in old age and
      use this setting to show that – even with a valid instrument – two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimates of
      interaction effects can be far away from the true effect. This is the case when treatment effects are heterogeneous
      and compliance to the instrument depends on the interaction variable. We suggest estimating marginal treatment
      effects to address this problem. Our estimation results show complementarities between education and genetic
      predisposition in determining later-life memory. The marginal treatment effect estimates suggest substantially
      larger gene-environment interactions than the 2SLS estimates.

        Life-cycle Health Effects of Compulsory Schooling
      </a>
    </p>
    <p class="paper-info">with Hendrik Schmitz and Beatrice Tawiah</p>
    <p>Accepted, <i>European Journal of Health Economics</i></p>
    <p class="abstract-toggle" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">+ Abstract</p>
    <div class="abstract">
      We study the effect of education on health (hospital stays, number of diagnosed conditions, self-rated poor health,
      and obesity) over the life-cycle using German compulsory schooling reforms as a source of exogenous variation. Our
      results show clear correlations between educational attainment and better health across all age groups (30 to 79).
      However, we do not find causal effects of an additional year of schooling on health or health care utilization,
      neither earlier, nor later in life. One reason for this may be that while the compulsory schooling reforms
      succeeded in raising the educational attainment of those that were targeted — individuals at the lowest education
      margin — they did not result in healthier employment opportunities.

        The Impact of Retirement on Loneliness in Europe
      </a>
    </p>
    <p class="paper-info">with Sophie Guthmuller, Dörte Heger and Anna Werbeck</p>

    <div class="abstract">
      This article investigates the short- and long-term impacts of retirement on loneliness using panel data from the
      Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe. To identify causal effects, we exploit differences in retirement
      rules across and within countries and use retirement thresholds in an instrumental variable setting. On average, we
      find that entering retirement leads to a reduction in loneliness in the long run and no clear effect in the short
      run. The reduction is driven by individuals being less likely to feel socially isolated and lacking companionship.
      Our results suggest that individuals adapt to retirement by increasing their activity levels and reap the benefits
      in terms of reduced loneliness and social isolation. The heterogeneity analysis shows that this is particularly
      true among the higher educated. The heterogeneity analysis also reveals that retirement increases feelings of
      loneliness for women in the short term and that the effect seems to be driven by women lacking companionship when
      their partner is not yet retired.

        A Nationwide Digital Maturity Assessment of Hospitals: Results From the German DigitalRadar

    <div class="abstract">
      In 2019, the German government established the Hospital Future Fund, allocating 4.3 billion Euros, to support
      investments in the digital infrastructure of hospitals. The DigitalRadar consortium was commissioned by the German
      Ministry of Health in 2020 to develop a holistic digital maturity model and evaluate the current state of
      digitalization and the impact of the funding program. To date, the nationwide digitalization of German hospitals
      has remained a relatively understudied phenomenon. This study aims to address this gap in knowledge by examining
      the influence of various factors identified by the DigitalRadar maturity model on the digital maturity of hospitals
      in Germany. In doing so, it seeks to elucidate the implications these findings have for the development of a
      digital, patient-centred, safe, and high-quality hospital landscape in the country. The model includes 234
      questions categorized into 7 dimensions of digitalization. 1,624 hospitals (91% of all German hospitals)
      participated. The average DigitalRadar score is 33 on a 100-point scale. Drivers include teaching status, size,
      connectivity, and level of emergency services.

    <div class="abstract">
      German hospitals largely rely on public investments for digitization. As these have been insufficient, hospitals
      had to use own profits to foster digital transformation. Thus, we assess if profitability affects digital maturity,
      and what other factors might be influential. We use DigitalRadar data (2021) and financial statement data (2017 to
      2019, n = 860). A one percentage point EBITDA margin increase is associated with a 0.359 points DR-score increase.
      Chain membership and chain size are positively associated with DR-score.

      With the Hospital Future Act, the German government has initiated a nationwide investment program of more than €
      4.3 bn to increase the digital maturity of the country’s hospitals. As part of this program, an evaluation project
      called “DigitalRadar” has been set up. The evaluation goal is to assess whether the funding achieved its goal to
      increase hospitals’ digital maturity. To this end, the DigitalRadar project consortium has developed a digital
      maturity measure, the DigitalRadar score (DR-score)...
