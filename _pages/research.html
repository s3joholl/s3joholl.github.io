            We study gene-environment interactions in the context of the long-term effect of education on cognition. Our central parameter of interest is the interaction effect between endogenous education and a predetermined measure of genetic endowment. Education is instrumented by a reform that raised compulsory schooling in England. We use this setting to show that two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimates of interaction effects can be misleading when there is essential heterogeneity (e.g., selection into gains) and complier status depends on the interaction variable. The 2SLS estimator cannot disentangle interaction effects from shifts in complier groups. Estimating marginal treatment effects addresses this problem by fixing the underlying population and unobserved heterogeneity. The results show complementarities between education and genetic predisposition in determining later-life memory, our measure of cognition. The marginal treatment effect estimates reveal a substantially larger gene-environment interaction, exceeding the 2SLS estimate by a factor of at least 4.7.

            We study the effect of education on health (hospital stays, number of diagnosed conditions, self-rated poor
            health, and obesity) over the life-cycle using German compulsory schooling reforms as a source of exogenous
            variation. Our results show clear correlations between educational attainment and better health across all
            age groups (30 to 79). However, we do not find causal effects of an additional year of schooling on health
            or health care utilization, neither earlier, nor later in life. One reason for this may be that while the
            compulsory schooling reforms succeeded in raising the educational attainment of those that were targeted —
            individuals at the lowest education margin — they did not result in healthier employment opportunities.

            This article investigates the short- and long-term impacts of retirement on loneliness using panel data from
            the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe. To identify causal effects, we exploit differences in
            retirement rules across and within countries and use retirement thresholds in an instrumental variable
            setting. On average, we find that entering retirement leads to a reduction in loneliness in the long run and
            no clear effect in the short run. The reduction is driven by individuals being less likely to feel socially
            isolated and lacking companionship. Our results suggest that individuals adapt to retirement by increasing
            their activity levels and reap the benefits in terms of reduced loneliness and social isolation. The
            heterogeneity analysis shows that this is particularly true among the higher educated. The heterogeneity
            analysis also reveals that retirement increases feelings of loneliness for women in the short term and that
            the effect seems to be driven by women lacking companionship when their partner is not yet retired.

        <div class="abstract">
            In 2019, the German government established the Hospital Future Fund, allocating 4.3 billion Euros, to
            support investments in the digital infrastructure of hospitals. The DigitalRadar consortium was commissioned
            by the German Ministry of Health in 2020 to develop a holistic digital maturity model and evaluate the
            current state of digitalization and the impact of the funding program. To date, the nationwide
            digitalization of German hospitals has remained a relatively understudied phenomenon. This study aims to
            address this gap in knowledge by examining the influence of various factors identified by the DigitalRadar
            maturity model on the digital maturity of hospitals in Germany. In doing so, it seeks to elucidate the
            implications these findings have for the development of a digital, patient-centred, safe, and high-quality
            hospital landscape in the country.
            The model was developed through a scoping review of digital maturity models, requirements set forth in the
            Hospital Future Act, analysis of components from existing models and feedback from a sounding board.
            Ultimately, the model includes 234 questions (items) categorized into 7 dimensions of digitalization. It was
            piloted in 12 hospitals and revised accordingly. 1,624 hospitals (91% of all German hospitals) participated
            in this self-assessment, as participation was mandatory to receive funding.
            The average DigitalRadar score on a 100-point scale is 33. Maturity is comparatively high in the structures
            and systems dimension, but low in the clinical processes, exchange of information, telemedicine and patient
            participation dimensions, suggesting that data exchange is hampered by a lack of interoperability. Drivers
            of digital maturity are teaching status, size, connectivity, and level of emergency services.
            The transparency gained allows hospitals and regulators to identify areas for improvement and develop
            digital strategies. Additionally, it enables researchers to analyse, for example, the correlation between
            digitalization and the quality of care, as well as the mechanisms of action of large-scale funding programs
            for hospital digitization.

            German hospitals largely rely on public investments for digitization. As these have been insufficient,
            hospitals had to use own profits to foster digital transformation. Thus, we assess if profitability affects
            digital maturity, and what other factors might be influential.
            We use digital maturity data from the DigitalRadar (DR) project (2021) and financial statement data from the
            Hospital Rating Report from 2017 to 2019 (n = 860). We run linear regressions with the DR-score (continuous
            variable from 0 to 100) as dependent and three-year average EBITDA margin as independent variable. Besides,
            we conduct subgroup analyses stratifying by chain size.
            A one percentage point EBITDA margin increase is associated with a 0.359 points DR-score increase.
            This relationship holds in significance and holds or increases in magnitude for all specifications
            except when adding chain beds (0.212 point DR-score increase). Besides, chain membership and
            chain size are positively and significantly associated with hospitals’ DR-score. EBITDA margins of the
            subgroups “large chains” and “Big 3″, i.e., the three largest chains, were strongly associated with the
            DR-score (2.685 and 3.197 points DR-score increase respectively). Conclusions Higher
            profitability is associated with higher digital maturity. Larger chains are digitally more mature,
            because (1) they might follow a chain-wide IT-strategy, (2) can standardize IT-architecture, and
            policies and (3) might cross-finance investments.

        <div class="abstract">
            With the Hospital Future Act, the German government has initiated a nationwide investment program of more than € 4.3 bn to increase the digital maturity of the country’s hospitals. As part of this program, an evaluation project called “DigitalRadar” has been set up. The evaluation goal is to assess whether the funding achieved its goal to increase hospitals’ digital maturity. To this end, the DigitalRadar project consortium has developed a digital maturity measure, the DigitalRadar score (DR-score). The DR-score is continuously scaled between 0 (not digitized) and 100 (fully digitized), providing detailed insights into hospitals’ digital maturity.   
            The DR-score allows for detailed analyses yielding different kinds of insights for health care provision and health system management: For instance,
            <ol>
                <li>transparency of a hospital’s digital maturity,</li>
                <li>the association of hospital profitability and digital maturity, and</li>
                <li>the relationship between digital maturity and hospital quality.</li>
            </ol>
            Regarding (1), the transparency of hospitals’ digital maturity, the DR-score can be used to understand whether the investment in hospital digitalization from the Hospital Future Act has actually increased digital maturity. Moreover, analyses can reveal what specific aspects of hospital digitalization, e.g., clinical processes or medication management, are more or less developed than others.   
            To investigate the relationship between digital maturity and (2) profitability or (3) hospital quality, the DR dataset needs to be matched to other datasets, e.g., structured hospital quality report cards. In this article, we describe the commonly used approach for matching hospitals and hospital sites with unique hospital identifiers and site numbers in German secondary datasets. Furthermore, we provide an overview of our findings from two studies investigating the relationship between profitability and digitalization as well as between digitalization and quality.   
            In the first study, we find a positive, statistically significant relationship between profitability and digital maturity, i.e., more profitable hospitals are digitally more mature. More importantly, membership in a large hospital chain is associated with significantly higher DR-scores. Regarding quality, there is no consistent correlation between digitalization and quality for the two process quality indicators, and only a weak association for the two outcome quality indicators selected for investigation. We plan to challenge these findings and to investigate the effect from within hospital changes in digital maturity on provider quality using longitudinal data once the second measurement period for the DR-score will be completed in the second half of 2024.   
            To support the generation of insights from digital maturity data for health system management, data quality must improve for matching datasets and for investigating the relationship between digital maturity, hospital profitability, and quality. Researchers must have access to nationwide databases containing financial statement data and quality indicators. Lastly, the digital maturity of hospitals must be measured continuously to monitor whether digitalization will reach its goal in increasing quality and decreasing cost of care.
