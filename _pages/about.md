Hi! I'm Johannes, a PhD candidate in Economics at Paderborn University and RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Essen, Germany.

My research areas include Applied Econometrics, Health Economics and Social Science Genomics. I am broadly interested in how decisions made over the lifecycle affect healthy aging, and in the role that (social) policy can play in supporting it. 
[comment] <> As part of my work in policy consulting at RWI, I have also written about the digitalization and the economic situation of hospitals.
