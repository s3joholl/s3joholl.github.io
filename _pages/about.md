Hi! I'm Johannes, a PhD candidate in Economics at Paderborn University and a researcher at RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Essen, Germany.

My research areas include applied econometrics, health, and education economics. I am broadly interested in how decisions made throughout the life course influence affect healthy aging, and in the role of policy in promoting and sustaining it.   
As part of my work in policy consulting at RWI, I have also written about the digitalization and the economic situation of hospitals.
