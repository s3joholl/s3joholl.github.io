Hi! I'm Johannes, a PhD candidate in Economics at Paderborn University and a researcher at RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Essen, Germany.

My main fields are applied econometrics and health economics, with a focus on health effects of education, the economics of aging, and social science genetics. I'm interested in how life decisions affect healthy aging, the role that pre-existing inequalities play, and what public policy can do to help.    
As part of my work in policy consulting at RWI, I have also written about the digitalization and the economic situation of hospitals.

I was a visitor at [UW-Madison](https://isg.wisc.edu/people/) in Fall 2024 and at [WU Vienna](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/institute-for-social-policy/) in Fall 2021.
