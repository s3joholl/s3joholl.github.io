Hi! I'm Johannes, a PhD candidate in Economics at Paderborn University and a researcher at RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Essen, Germany.

My main field is health economics, with a focus on education and the economics of aging. I study how life decisions affect healthy aging and how public policy can help. More broadly, I am interested program evaluation.
As part of my work in policy consulting at RWI, I have also written about the digitalization and the economic situation of hospitals.

I was a visitor at [UW-Madison](https://isg.wisc.edu/people/) in Fall 2024. 

You can find my CV [here](https://s3joholl.github.io/files/hollenbach_cv.pdf) and contact me at johannes.hollenbach[at]rwi-essen.de.
