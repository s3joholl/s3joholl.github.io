Hi! I'm Johannes, a PhD candidate in Economics at Paderborn University and RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Essen, Germany.

My research areas include applied econometrics, health and education economics. I am broadly interested in how (social) policy can support healthy aging. 

As part of my work in policy consulting at RWI, I have also written about the digitalization and the economic situation of hospitals.

You can find my CV [here](https://s3joholl.github.io/files/hollenbach_cv.pdf) and contact me at johannes.hollenbach[at]rwi-essen.de.
